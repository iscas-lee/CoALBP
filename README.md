# Co-occurrence of Adjacent Local Binary Patterns

The Co-occurrence of Adjacent Local Binary Patterns algorithm [1] is an extention of the original Local Binary Patterns algorithm [2]. It uses a simplified version of the Local Binary Patterns, by only taking the four direct neighbours into account (resulting in 16 possible patterns). After calculating all the patterns for every pixel it counts how often two patterns co-occur together, allowing more complex representation.
